% sum(N, Sum) - Sum is the sum of integers from 1 to N
sum(0, 0).  % base case

sum(N, Sum) :-
    N > 0,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum(N1, Sum1),
    Sum is Sum1 + N.

% Run automatically when the program starts
:- initialization(main).

main :-
    N = 15,  % You can change this to any number
    sum(N, Result),
    format('Sum from 1 to ~w is ~w~n', [N, Result]),
